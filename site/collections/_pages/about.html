      <p>Hello there! Do you share my passion for building communities and
      making a positive impact on them?</p><p>Let me tell you a little about
      myself: in 2015, I started a business from scratch and successfully scaled
      it within a year. In 2017, I handed it off to my partners and transitioned
      to working as a graphic designer. After four years, I discovered the world
      of community building.</p><p>However, even before then, I had been
      building communities without knowing the formal terminology for it. For
      example, I created successful gaming communities on Discord and
      effectively expanded them over time, eventually delegating
      responsibilities to other passionate users.</p><p>I aim to bring together
      like-minded individuals with the goal of creating a strong sense of
      community and significant business value.</p><p>Nothing motivates me more
      than helping others and bringing people together.</p><p>Lastly, I am a
      huge animal lover, with a soft spot for creatures of all shapes and sizes,
      whether they live on land, in the mountains, or in the sea and
      sky.</p><p>And I am always just a ping away!</p><p>According to
      me,</p><blockquote><p><strong>Community Builders are the Unsung
      Superheroes who don’t wear capes.</strong>​​​​​​</p></blockquote>
