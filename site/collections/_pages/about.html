      <p>Hi! I love building communities and contributing in them, do you
      also?</p><p>A little about me: After building a business from scratch in
      2015 and scaling it to success within a year, working as a freelance
      graphic designer for almost 4 years, I discovered the world of community
      building.</p><p>Although I had been building communities long before that,
      without knowing the formal terminology for it. On Discord, I started
      gaming communities and effectively expanded them over time, handing the
      reins off to other engaged users at later stage.</p><p>I build communities
      with the goal of connecting people who want to connect with others with
      shared interests. Creating significant business value in the
      process.</p><p>Helping people and bringing them together is what motivates
      me.</p><p>I am a big time zoophilist, from smallest to largest, from land
      to mountains and from sea to sky, I love them all.</p><p>And I am always
      just a ping away!</p><p>According to
      me,</p><blockquote><p><strong>Community Builders are the Unsung
      Superheroes who don’t wear capes.</strong>​​​​​​</p></blockquote>
