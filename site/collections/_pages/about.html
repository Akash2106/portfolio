      <p>Are you someone who shares my passion for building thriving communities
      and making a positive impact on the world around us?</p><p>Let me
      introduce myself. In 2015, I founded a business from scratch and
      successfully scaled it within a year. Following that, I transitioned to
      working as a graphic designer for four years before discovering my true
      calling in community building. Since then, I've been building multiple
      communities and hosting online and offline <a target="_blank"
      rel="noopener"
      href="https://akashagrawal.xyz/project/events"><strong>events</strong></a>,
      including global events, as part of the&nbsp;<a target="_blank"
      rel="noopener"
      href="https://akashagrawal.xyz/project/community-folks"><strong>Community
      Folks</strong></a>.team.</p><p>I'm also a founding team member of a travel
      startup called "<a target="_blank" rel="noopener"
      href="https://akashagrawal.xyz/project/travander"><strong>Travander</strong></a>."
      As part of the team, I helped develop a clear business model, design a
      go-to-market strategy, identify the right demographic, create a community
      strategy, and launch it with internal members.</p><p>But the truth is,
      community building has been a part of me all along. Even before I knew the
      formal terminology for it, I was creating successful gaming communities on
      Discord and expanding them over time by delegating responsibilities to
      other passionate users.</p><p>My ultimate goal is to bring together
      like-minded individuals and foster a strong sense of community, while also
      delivering significant business value.</p><p>Helping others and bringing
      people together is what truly motivates me, and I'm always just a ping
      away! Oh, and did I mention that I'm also a huge animal lover with a soft
      spot for creatures big and small, whether they reside on land, in the
      mountains, or in the sea and sky?</p><p>According to
      me,</p><blockquote><p>Community Builders are the Unsung Superheroes who
      donâ€™t wear capes.</p></blockquote>
